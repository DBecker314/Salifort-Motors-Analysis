The goal of this project was to find an accurate way to predict employee retention based on company employee data.  The best performing model was a little more than 98% accurate in determining whether an employee would stay or leave.  Based on this model, satisfaction, last evaluation, number of projects assigned, years at the company, and hours per month were the most influencial factors for employee retention.
